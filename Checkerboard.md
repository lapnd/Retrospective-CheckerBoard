# Retrospective-CheckerBoard

#### This retrospective is to have you reflect on the work you did and compare it to the solution provided below.

##### 1. Reflect on (think about) the work you did for the challenge. How did you do? What did you get right? What did you get wrong? What did you do differently (and possibly better) than what was posted in the solution? What was hard to do?
```sh
 * I think I did well since I got result right.
 * I would remove a little bit of extra space at the bottom of the window out. 
 * The diffult part that I encountered with is tyring to make the board changing 
   the size according with the window size.
```

##### 2. How well did you understand the programming concepts and foundational knowledge needed to complete the challenge?
```sh
* I did have a basic foundational knowledge from CS3330, but I have a challege about 
  undersding event handler and listener becuase I didn't really use it in the past.
```

##### 3. How well did you meet the requirements as set out in the challenge? What requirements did you not meet correctly (if any)?
```sh
* I think I met the challege requirements since my implementation looks pretty similar 
  to the solution that was given and the result came out to be right. 
```

##### 4. How well does your solution match the posted solution? What is different?
```sh
* They are closely matched. But I put code in functions more and I have 2 packages 
  instead of one whole pagake like the solution.
```

##### 5. How could you improve going forward? What don't you still understand that was required for the challenge?
```sh
* I could make my code more compact and more effient to make the code run faster and more resposive. I don't understand why the 
  JavaFX sometime make weird result even I implemented correctly. 
```
